Q1:
a. sigsetjmp(): This function saves the current environment state into a specified buffer.
If called directly, it returns 0. When returning from a call to siglongjmp(), it returns a non-zero value.
siglongjmp(): This function restores the state saved by sigsetjmp() for the same thread.
If there is no corresponding invocation or if the function containing the sigsetjmp() call has terminated,
the behavior is undefined.
The second parameter provided to siglongjmp() will be returned by sigsetjmp() if it is invoked by siglongjmp().
b. If the second argument of sigsetjmp() is non-zero, the current signal mask will be saved as part of the
environment state.

Q2:
An example of usage is when developing a program that requires threads and might run on an operating system that
doesn't support them.
Using user-level threads is practical in this scenario because your program needs threading capabilities,
and if the OS lacks this support, the program would not function correctly.

Q3:
Advantages:
1. Security: If one tab is compromised by a virus, it is more challenging for the virus to access information
in other tabs.
2. Concurrency: If one tab becomes unresponsive, it does not affect the performance of other tabs.

Disadvantages:
1. Communication Overhead: Inter-process communication requires a switch to the kernel, which is time-consuming.
2. Process Creation Overhead: Creating a new process takes more time than creating a new thread.

Q4:
During the execution of the command, hardware interrupts are triggered by the keyboard and mouse movements.
Opening Shotwell and running ps and kill commands involve system calls to create processes,
which are implemented using interrupts.
The kill command uses the kill system call, triggering a software interrupt to terminate the application.

Q5:
Real-time is measured by the CPU clock regardless of which process is running,
while virtual time is measured only when a specific process is executing.
Additionally, virtual time is defined by the process using a timer with a custom interval,
whereas real-time is continuously measured.
